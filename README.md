# bamazon
this is a bamazon node.js app
which will eventually have 3 different levels to it. But fo rnow i am trying to make the 1st level which is just customer. We will have the choice of selecting a product from the table and then selecting the quantity of our choice. Right now i have most of the code in the files for everything to work but it keeps looping over the 1st question. I have the code for everything else for the customer side. But its just the app itself gets stuck on the 1st question.
